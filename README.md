🗡️ Blade - Campus Assassination Game

Blade is a web-based remake of the classic “Assassins” campus game.

Players register, receive secret targets, and log their kills (verified by unique blade codes). A live leaderboard keeps suspense high until one last player remains.

## Who should play Blade?


Blade is perfect for:

- University dorms & hostels – perfect for orientation week or end-of-term stress relief
- Office teams – lighthearted team-building that sparks strategy and camaraderie
- Summer camps & youth groups – easy to run, no fancy gear required
- Any group up for a stealth-and-strategy showdown — if quick wits, covert moves, and topping the leaderboard fire you up, Blade is right in your sweet spot.


##  Core Features

- **Sign-up / Login / Logout** (session-based)
- **Admin panel** to assign targets, reset the game, or remove players
- **Automatic circular target assignment** with one-click shuffle
- **Kill confirmation** via 5-character alphanumeric blade codes
- **Live leaderboard** tracking kills & blades collected
- **GPS location update endpoints** (JSON-based) — handy for map overlays
- **Winner / Eliminated screens** for immersive game flow
- **Auto-refreshing dashboards** — player and admin views update every 5 seconds to reflect live game state
- **Quick reset** to original test players for easy testing & demos
